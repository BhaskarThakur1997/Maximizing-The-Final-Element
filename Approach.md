1. **Sorting the List:**
   - `Collections.sort(arr)`: The input list `arr` is sorted in ascending order.

2. **Ensuring the First Element is 1:**
   - `arr.set(0, Math.max(arr.get(0), 1))`: The first element of the sorted list is set to the maximum of its current value and 1. This ensures that the first element is at least 1.

3. **Ensuring the Difference between Adjacent Elements is at Most 1:**
   - The loop from `i = 1` to `i < arr.size()`: Iterates through the list starting from the second element.
   - Inside the loop:
     - `if (arr.get(i) - arr.get(i - 1) > 1)`: Checks if the difference between the current element and the previous element is greater than 1.
     - If true, `arr.set(i, arr.get(i - 1) + 1)`: Updates the current element to make the difference exactly 1.

4. **Returning the Maximum Value:**
   - `return arr.get(arr.size() - 1)`: Returns the maximum value, which is now the last element in the sorted and processed list.
